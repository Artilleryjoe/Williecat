# Williecat – Reconnaissance with Instinct

Williecat is a modular reconnaissance and OSINT assistant designed to gather
passive intelligence before you make any loud moves. Built as a tribute to
Willie the cat, the toolkit focuses on stealthy collection, structured
reporting, and extensibility.

## Features

- **WHOIS + RDAP:** Discover registration, expiration, and nameserver data via
  public RDAP services with quiet RDAP lookups.
- **Header Sniffer:** Perform standard library `HEAD` requests with rotating
  user-agents to catalogue server headers without pulling a full body.
- **Passive DNS:** Enumerate A/AAAA/MX/NS/TXT records using Google's DNS over
  HTTPS resolver.
- **Certificate Transparency:** Scrape recent certificates from `crt.sh` for
  additional domains and hostnames that may reference the target.
- **IP Intelligence:** Pull ASN and geolocation data from ipinfo.io, optionally
  resolving hostnames to addresses first.
- **Social Trace:** Sweep Hacker News and Reddit mentions to capture emerging
  chatter about the target without logging in anywhere.
- **Report Exporter:** Emit Markdown and JSON outputs so every recon run keeps
  the same Williecat voice.
- **Pawprints Log:** Each execution appends JSONL metadata to `pawprints.log`
  for audit trails.
- **Quiet Mode:** Use `--quiet` to silence console chatter and keep the claws
  sheathed.
- **Demo Mode:** Run `--demo` to generate canned results for demos and tests
  without touching the network.

## Installation

Williecat relies only on the Python standard library. Clone the repository and
run the tool with Python 3.10 or newer.

## Usage

The banner appears on launch unless `--quiet` is supplied:

```
/\_/\  Williecat v0.1
( o.o ) Reconnaissance with Instinct
^ <
```

Run a focused recon sweep:

```bash
python -m williecat --domain example.com --modules whois,headers,dns,certs,ip,social --output recon_report.md
```

### Command-line options

Run `python -m williecat --help` to view all arguments. Key flags include:

- `--domain` – Domain name to investigate.
- `--ip` – IP address to enrich (auto-resolved if omitted and `--domain` is
  supplied).
- `--url` – Full URL for HTTP header collection.
- `--modules` – Comma-separated list of modules to execute (defaults to all).
- `--output` – Path to write a Markdown report.
- `--json-output` – Path to write raw JSON results.
- `--timeout` – Network timeout (seconds).
- `--list-modules` – List available modules and exit.
- `--quiet` – Suppress the ASCII banner and inline module summaries.
- `--demo` – Emit a fully-populated, canned report for demos or offline tests.

Want to trial the reporting flow without network access? Launch demo mode:

```
python -m williecat --demo --output recon_report.md --json-output recon_report.json
```

Each run is also recorded to `pawprints.log` as newline-delimited JSON for
simple ingestion or replay.

### Example report

The following is the exact Markdown generated by running

```bash
python -m williecat --domain example.com --modules whois,headers,dns,certs,ip --output recon_report.md --quiet
```

```

## Extending Williecat

Modules live in `williecat/modules/`. Each module subclasses `ReconModule` and
returns a `ModuleResult`. Register new modules by adding them to
`get_module_registry()` in `williecat/modules/__init__.py`.

## License

Williecat is released under the MIT license. Use responsibly and honor the
stealthy spirit of Willie—gather quietly, act with precision.

## Tribute to Willie

Willie was the office sentry who inspired this project...an endlessly curious
tabby who could map every corner of a room with a single sweep of his tail.
When he wasn't overseeing reconnaissance runs from the top of a dresser, he was
curled up beside a stack of German dictionaries, reminding us that observation and
patience are the heart of good intelligence work. May every quiet scan and
carefully documented lead carry forward his curious spirit and gentle paws.
